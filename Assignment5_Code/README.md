A bookstore system with Barnes & Noble and Amazon packages. Implements cart pricing, availability checks, and purchase processing. Uses JUnit 5, Mockito, Checkstyle, and JaCoCo. CI via GitHub Actions.

## Part 1 - BarnesAndNoble Tests
- **Specification-Based**: Null order, full/partial availability, empty cart.
- **Structural-Based**: Branch coverage (if/else), loop coverage, null book handling.
- Used `@Nested`, `@DisplayName`, and Mockito for isolation.
- All tests pass locally.
